This is an idea stolen directly from Dave Rupert. He has this nice looking bookshelf of all the books he's recently read or is currently reading. And that's all fine and good, but I can never make the time to sit down and read a book. I do, however, listen to quite a lot of audiobooks while I work, do chores or commute. I'm basically always wearing headphones if I'm not with my family. So I thought I'd share some of my thoughts on the recent audiobooks I've heard.

Now, this won't be a comprehensive review or assessment on the book. This won't be a comprehensive anything really. I just want to share my thoughts on what I read and how I felt about it. I will only focus on what I liked. There's plenty of people criticizing everything only and I am no expert. I'm not very good (or consistent) at writing so who am I to judge.

So if you're interested, go take a look. There are links to every book so you can buy them on Audible (my service of choice; I don't think there's another). They aren't affiliated links, though that might change. I'll definitely update this post and mention it on the [colophon](/colophon). Anyways, hope you like it. If you want you can complain about something I said on {{< link href="https://twitter.com/fourjuaneight" content="twitter">}}.
