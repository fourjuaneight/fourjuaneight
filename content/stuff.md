## About the Site
The site's look and feel is a shamelessly inspired from {{< link href="https://daverupert.com/" content="Dave Rupert's" >}} blog and some of my previous projects. The themes used are copied from {{< link href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bear-beautiful-writing-app/id1016366447" content="Bear Notes" >}}. The box and avatar where "designed" by me. The box is a generic box. I'm not sure why it's there. And the avatar is based on {{< link href="http://onepunchman.wikia.com/wiki/Saitama" content="Saitama" >}}.
