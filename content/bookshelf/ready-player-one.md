Nostalgia is a powerful thing. I can be instantly transported to a moment in time where things were great and the world made sense. I can even relive precious moments with loved ones no longer with me. Which I guess is why we see it everywhere in films, tv and of course, books. Although it's often exploited to point of ruining the story, I find it so enjoyable on Ready Player One. Ernest unapologetically crammed in everything he loved from his youth into an action-packed story. I saw the movie before I read the book. And although there were plenty of more modern references to pop culture there, I related a lot more to the book's references. The challenges the characters go through felt, well, more challenging. Which showed me much more about who they were. Yeah, too much nostalgia can be a lot to take in for some. But I felt good reading this book and was transported to some great times while reading it.
