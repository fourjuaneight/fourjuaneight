There are many wonderful things about Binti. Things quickly take a twist and the story only gets better and more intriguing from there. But what stood out to me was everything Binti goes through emotionally. It takes a lot from her to leave her home and traditions for her dreams. Throughout her journey, she experiences criticism and actual persecution. And despite all that, she manages to overcome adversity and achieve what she wanted. But then, there's still doubt. It's not that what she dreamed of doesn't live up to her expectations. Which is often the case for many of us. But rather, she wonders whether the sacrifice was worth it and if it ever will feel like it was. That's a powerful sentiment which is not often talked about, but one I've personally experienced a few times.
