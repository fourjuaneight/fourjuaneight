# About Me :
Hi, I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for strangers online. I currently work in healthcare as a Software Engineer with a Front-End focus. When I'm not working, I'm usually still coding. Though these days I've been going through my Steam backlog thanks to the Steam Deck.

- If you're interested in what I'm currently messing around with, take a look at my pinned repos underneath.
