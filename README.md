Hi, I'm Juan and I like websites. Most of my time is spent making them for strangers online. I work as a Senior Full-Stack Developer over at [Big Pixel](https://thebigpixel.net). When I'm not working, I'm usually still coding. There's always something to automate.

- Links are over on the left (top on mobile?) if you want to reach out.
- If you're interested in what I'm currently messing around with, take a look at my pinned repos underneath.
